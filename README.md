**FileMonitor**

FileMonitor is a Python class designed to monitor a specified log file for changes. It operates as a separate thread, periodically checking for file modifications. When a new file is written to, the class automatically creates a new output file based on the detected pattern and writes subsequent content to it.

**Features**

Multithreaded operation: Runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main program.

Dynamic file creation: Automatically creates new output files when a new pattern is found.

Pattern-based splitting: Splits a single input log file into multiple output files based on a BEGIN: pattern.

Buffering: Lines are buffered and written to the next detected pattern file, ensuring no data is lost between patterns.

**Getting Started
**Prerequisites
Python 3.x

**Installation**
No installation is needed. Simply copy the file_monitor.py file (or your script containing the FileMonitor class) into your project directory.

**How to Use
**The FileMonitor class is straightforward to use. You need to create an instance of the class and start the thread.

1. **Create the log file to be monitored:** The script assumes a log file named log_runtime.txt exists in the same directory. You can either create this file manually or modify the file_path variable in the example usage section.
2. **Run the script:**

```bash

python your_script_name.py

```

Example
The following example demonstrates how to set up and run the FileMonitor class.

```Python

import time
import threading
import os

# Assuming the FileMonitor class is in the same file or can be imported
class FileMonitor(threading.Thread):
    # ... (your class code here) ...

# Example usage
file_path = "log_runtime.txt"

# Create and start the FileMonitor thread
monitor_thread = FileMonitor(file_path)
monitor_thread.start()

# Keep the main thread running to prevent the program from exiting
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Program terminated by user.")
    # You might want to add a way to gracefully stop the thread here
```

The script will start monitoring log_runtime.txt. When you add new lines to this file, the FileMonitor thread will detect the changes.

**Log File Format** 
The FileMonitor class looks for a specific pattern to create new output files. The pattern must start with the BEGIN: keyword, followed by the name of the pattern.

For example, a log file might look like this:

```
Some initial log data
This is a log line
BEGIN: First Pattern
Data for the first pattern
More data for the first pattern
BEGIN: Second Pattern
Data for the second pattern
```

When this file is monitored, the script will:

1. Create a file named First_Pattern.txt containing "BEGIN: First Pattern" and the following lines.
2. Create a file named Second_Pattern.txt containing "BEGIN: Second Pattern" and subsequent lines.

The name of the output file is generated by replacing spaces in the pattern name with underscores and adding a .txt extension.
